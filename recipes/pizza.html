        <li>1/2 cup basil pesto</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped or shredded kale</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>6 ounces creamy goat cheese, crumbled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded fontina cheese</li>
        <li>1 medium zucchini or summer squash, shaved into ribbons</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly torn</li>

    <h4>Recipe Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a large baking sheet with olive oil.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Make the pesto, if using homemade. In a blender or food processor, combine all ingredients and pulse until smooth. Taste and add salt as needed. Keep stored in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, push/roll the dough out until it is pretty thin (about a 10-12 inch circle). Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Spread the dough with pesto, top evenly with kale, and drizzle with olive oil. Season lightly with salt and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. Top with crumbled goat cheese and fontina cheese. Arrange the zucchini ribbons over the cheese, drizzle lightly with olive oil and season with salt.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Transfer to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese has melted. Top the pizza with fresh basil and crushed red pepper flakes. ENJOY! </li>
    </ol>
